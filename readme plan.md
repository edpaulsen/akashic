Got it. Let’s lock in a clear **MVP goal statement** that captures AI, AWS, and compliance, so you can share it. Here’s a concise version that frames what you’re building:

## 🏗️ MVP Goal Statement – Akashic Lookup API

The **Akashic Lookup API** is a healthcare-focused microservice that translates **patient-friendly terms** (e.g., “high blood pressure”) into **canonical FHIR® codes** (SNOMED CT for conditions, LOINC for labs/observations).

* **AI-powered learning:**
  Uses fuzzy matching plus feedback loops to “learn” new mappings over time, reducing manual coding effort and aligning patient input with clinical standards.

* **Practitioner + Patient views:**
  Returns both layperson language and clinical terminology, ensuring patients see familiar terms while clinicians see canonical codes.

* **AWS-native deployment:**
  Designed to run on **AWS Lambda + API Gateway**, backed by **S3 (code/data storage)** and **DynamoDB (learned mappings)**, ensuring **scalable, serverless, HIPAA-ready infrastructure**.

* **Compliance-first design:**
  Built for **HIPAA** and **21st Century Cures Act interoperability** requirements. Encodes data as **FHIR CodeableConcepts**, supporting downstream EHR integration.

* **MVP Objective:**
  Deliver a working API that (1) reliably translates patient-friendly health terms into FHIR-compliant codes, (2) supports practitioner overrides and AI-assisted learning, and (3) runs securely on AWS with minimal operational overhead.
