Akashic Lookup API makes healthcare data easier to use by translating everyday patient language (like “high blood pressure”) into official medical codes (SNOMED CT, LOINC) that electronic health records require. It uses AI to continuously learn from practitioner feedback, ensuring accuracy and reducing manual work. Built on secure AWS infrastructure, it’s designed for HIPAA compliance and seamless integration into digital health platforms.
